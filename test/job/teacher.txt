Organization Overview
RIPL is a national network of free, open‐enrollment, college‐preparatory public schools in under‐resourced communities throughout the United States. There are currently 200 locally‐run RIPL schools in 20 states and Washington, DC, and nationally RIPL serves approximately 80,000 students. More than 80 percent of RIPL students come from low‐income households, and more than 95 percent are African American or Hispanic/Latino. Through high expectations for students and staff, world‐class teachers and principals, more time in school, autonomy over budget and curriculum, and a focus on results, RIPL schools prepare traditionally underserved students for success in college and in life. RIPL schools have been widely recognized for their success in doing so, and today nearly 85% of RIPL alumni nationally have matriculated to college.
All RIPL schools share a core set of operating principles, known as the Five Pillars, that RIPL believes help to lay the foundation for students to perform at the highest academic levels: High Expectations, Choice & Commitment, More Time, Power to Lead, and a Focus on Results.
RIPL Rhode Island Overview
Who we are: RIPL Rhode Island Schools is a network of high-performing college-preparatory public charter schools. Next year, we will serve over 700 students in grades K through 2 and grades 5 through 8 at two co-located schools (primary and middle) in north Providence. RIPL Rhode Island Schools is a fast-growing, entrepreneurial organization with significant growth plans in the coming years.
What we do: We do whatever it takes to help our students develop knowledge, skills, and strong character. We work relentlessly so that every one of our students has the opportunity to attend college and has access to the life of choice and opportunity that college provides. The RIPL Rhode Island Regional Team supports our schools, school leaders, and staff through organizational and academic alignment, business management, strategic planning, and back office functions.
How we do it: There are no shortcuts to success. Outstanding educators, rigorous lessons, more time in school, and strong school culture support our students as they climb the mountain to college. We work as a team, use data, and constantly reflect to improve our practice. We believe all of our RIPLsters can make it to and through college and we stay with them every step of the way.

Why it matters: In our communities, approximately 1 in 10 students earn a college degree. We believe that this is unjust and unacceptable and, most importantly, can be changed. Nationwide, over 85% of RIPL middle school alums matriculate to college.
RIPL Rhode Island is seeking for exceptional licensed General Education teachers for our upcoming School year.
We offer highly competitive salary and benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision and retirement benefit.
Starting Salary: $44,880+
Other benefits we offer include a number of paid days off including breaks (we take a full week in November and other points throughout the school year!) plus 8 additional PTO days for Teachers. We also have "Friday for you" (AKA an afternoon off) once per month.
Outside of the traditional employee benefits, joining the national RIPL network comes with several professional advantages. With over 240 schools across the country, our access to resources, development, and professional connections is best in class.
The district is willing to work with applicants whose license is in process OR request for Out of Field Permission license as needed.
